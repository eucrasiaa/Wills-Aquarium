# each fish includes:
1. art
    - support multiple and single frames
    - support for static elements (should be rendered and handled the same as fish for internal behaviour?)
    - assumedly should parse based on the given width and height to determine number of frames, but could also have a provided attrib for frames as a first and fallback to?
        - ooor just throw a fail on incorrect format and make it not my problem LOL :3
2. variables:
    - internal name for debug or user identification type
    - 


# should establish ELEMENT TYPES!
