# Will's Terminal Aquarium
a little C recreation of a classic terminal aquarium
work in progress 1-29-2026

## TODO:
- currently fish art is hard and hand coded. want to make it dyanically read from file and support motion types
- such that adding a fish or element is telling width/height, motion type (bounce, wrap, static), colors, frames, and a templated motion or behaviour:
    - ex: fish = goes left or right, wraps or bounces
    - decor static with animation maybe
    - random? bubbles? with
    need to determine formats, handling, and a bunch of un-hardcoding LOL
